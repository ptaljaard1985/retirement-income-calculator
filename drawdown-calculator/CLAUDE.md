# CLAUDE.md

This file is read first by Claude Code on every session. It tells you what this project is, how it's built, and the conventions that matter.

## What this is

A standalone HTML retirement drawdown calculator for Simple Wealth (Pty) Ltd, a South African authorised financial services provider (FSP 50637). One file, `retirement_drawdown.html`, opens by double-click, prints to PDF cleanly, and is used by the adviser (Pierre) with clients in real meetings.

The calculator models a two-spouse South African household with living annuities plus discretionary (taxable) portfolios. It projects year-by-year to the youngest spouse's age 100, applying SARS 2026/27 income tax with bracket creep, CGT on discretionary gains, and the legislated 2.5%–17.5% LA withdrawal band. It supports auto-top-up from discretionary, LA boosting to the ceiling, and one-off capital inflows (property sales, inheritances).

The target audience for this code is whoever (adviser or Claude) needs to update it in February each year when SARS tables change, or add a feature the adviser decides is worth having. Anything not strictly necessary to that goal has been resisted by design.

## Non-negotiable design constraints

These are not preferences. Breaking any of them is a regression:

1. **Single file**. Everything — HTML, CSS, JS — lives in `retirement_drawdown.html`. No build step, no npm, no React. The only external dependency is Chart.js from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com`. The file must open with `file://` and work offline except for the chart library.
2. **Prints to PDF cleanly**. Browser print dialog produces a compliance-ready document with inputs, outputs, methodology, and FSP disclaimer. Never break `@media print`.
3. **Math is auditable**. Any change to a calculation must come with a Python test in `tests/python/` that implements the same logic from scratch and agrees to the cent with the JS. If you can't write a closed-form or manual trace that matches, the change is unsafe.
4. **Warm paper aesthetic, not SaaS**. Background `#faf9f5`, brand navy `#2d3e50`, hairline borders, no gradients, no shadows, no animations, no emoji. Details in `docs/DESIGN.md`.
5. **South African context**. Rands with space separators ("R6 000 000"), SARS 2026/27 tax tables, FAIS/POPIA disclaimer with FSP 50637. Never swap to comma separators or generic USD conventions.

## How the code is organised

Inside the single HTML file:

- **Lines ~1–560**: CSS, using `:root` CSS variables as design tokens.
- **Lines ~560–1070**: HTML — header, client bar, household position, needs section, capital events, summary cards, chart/table slot, sliders, print summary, disclaimer.
- **Lines ~1075–1330**: SARS tax constants + year-aware helpers (brackets/rebates scaled by `(1+creep)^y`), CGT inclusion, `stepPerson`.
- **Lines ~1340–1600**: `project()` — the year loop, `solveTopUp()` three-phase solver, returns all series.
- **Lines ~1600–1850**: Rendering — `updateCards`, `buildChart`, `buildIncomeChart`, `buildYearTable`, `updatePrintSummary`, `updateAlerts`.
- **Lines ~1850–end**: Wiring — event listeners, toggles, solve-for, events store, init.

See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for more detail on any section.

## Core calculation convention (the one thing that's easy to get wrong)

- Projections are annual, iterating Y1 through Y_final (not starting at Y2).
- Series position `i` represents year `i+1`: `laSeriesNom[i]` is the start-of-that-year LA balance (before that year's draw); `drawSeriesNom[i]` is the draw *during* that year.
- Each year: (a) read start-of-year balance, (b) compute draws via solver, (c) apply draws, (d) grow remainder at nominal return, (e) apply any capital events landing that year.
- LA draws escalate in **rand terms at CPI** each year (not as a re-computed % of balance), clamped into the 2.5%–17.5% band. This reflects how living annuities actually work in South Africa.

See `docs/CALCULATIONS.md` for full maths and tax rules.

## Working style (what Pierre wants)

- **Direct, concise communication.** Push back when you see something wrong. No filler.
- **Scope discipline.** If asked to change X, change X. Do not refactor Y "while you're in there" unless Y is broken in a way that blocks X.
- **Ask one sharp question when ambiguous**, not three safe ones. Use the `ask_user_input_v0` tool if available.
- **Audit the math before shipping.** Never declare a financial calculation change finished without a passing Python test.
- **Don't narrate the design system** back. Just build to spec.
- **No emoji anywhere in the product**, not in the UI, not in generated documents.

## When you're asked to make a change

Run through this checklist:

1. **Is it a math change?** If yes — write or update the Python test in `tests/python/` FIRST. Make sure it fails with the current code (i.e. you've correctly captured the desired new behaviour). Then change the JS. Then verify the test passes.
2. **Is it a UI change?** Check it renders on screen AND in the print dialog. The print stylesheet is at the bottom of the `<style>` block and is easy to regress.
3. **Is it a design-system change?** Almost always no. The palette, typography, and spacing are deliberate. If you think they need to change, stop and ask.
4. **Does it touch SARS tables or bracket creep?** There's a separate `docs/SARS_UPDATES.md` playbook for the annual refresh. Read it first.
5. **Does it break the print output?** Open the file in a browser, hit Cmd+P, check the preview. The print summary must be a complete, self-contained record of the projection.

## Running tests

```bash
# Python tests (math audits)
cd tests/python
pytest

# JS tests (solver behaviour)
cd tests/js
node run.js
```

Both must pass before any change ships. See `tests/README.md`.

## File inventory

- `retirement_drawdown.html` — the deliverable. This is the product.
- `README.md` — human-readable project overview, for GitHub.
- `CLAUDE.md` — this file.
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — code structure in detail.
- `docs/CALCULATIONS.md` — the maths and tax rules.
- `docs/DESIGN.md` — visual system and interaction patterns.
- `docs/SARS_UPDATES.md` — annual update playbook.
- `tests/python/` — math audits in Python.
- `tests/js/` — JS solver tests in Node.

## What not to do

- **Don't bundle.** No webpack, no rollup, no esbuild. The file is the file.
- **Don't add dependencies.** Chart.js is the only runtime dependency. No `Chart.js plugins`, no `lodash`, no `moment`.
- **Don't introduce a backend.** The calculator is stateless and client-side. Anything that needs persistence goes somewhere else (the CRM Pierre is building separately).
- **Don't add analytics, tracking, or telemetry.** Client financial data must stay in the browser.
- **Don't rename `retirement_drawdown.html`.** Pierre emails clients direct links to it; renaming breaks bookmarks.
- **Don't reformat the whole file in one commit.** Diff review is how regressions get caught; a 2000-line whitespace change defeats that.

## When in doubt

Ask. Pierre would rather answer one question now than fix a silent regression later.
